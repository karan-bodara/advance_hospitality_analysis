# 🏨 Advance Hospitality Analysis

## 🛠️ Overview
This project demonstrates how a single dataset can drive comprehensive business insights and predictive analytics using three powerful tools:
- **Power BI** for Data Visualization
- **Python (EDA)** for Data Exploration
- **Machine Learning** for Predictive Modeling

By applying different skillsets on the same dataset, the project highlights the complete data journey — from exploration to visualization to prediction — providing actionable intelligence for decision-making in the hospitality sector.

## Project Components

### 1. 📊 Power BI Dashboard
- Designed interactive and dynamic dashboards to visualize key business metrics.
- Analyzed booking trends, revenue patterns, occupancy rates, and platform performance.
- Delivered insights across **cities**, **room categories**, **booking platforms** etc.
- Enabled stakeholders to easily identify high-performing properties and optimize operational strategies.

### 2. 🧹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python
- Performed extensive data cleaning, transformation, and exploration using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.
- Uncovered hidden patterns like seasonal booking behaviors, room capacity utilization, and customer preferences.
- Generated feature-rich datasets ready for machine learning applications.

### 3. 🤖 Machine Learning Model
- Built a predictive model (e.g., **Random Forest Regressor**, **Linear Regression**) to forecast key outcomes such as:
  - Price Prediction
  - City Prediction etc
    

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- **Power BI** (dax)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** (Random Forest, Linear Regression, etc.)

## 🧠 Key Business Questions Answered
- Which properties generate the highest revenue and occupancy?
- How do booking trends vary across seasons and cities?
- Which room categories and booking platforms drive more bookings?
- Can we predict high-demand periods early to optimize pricing strategies (dynamic pricing recommendations)?
- How do booking trends fluctuate month-over-month, week-over-week, and across different seasons (peak vs off-peak)?



## 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out
- **Cross-Tool Application:** Shows expertise in Visualization (Power BI), Data Analysis (Python EDA), and Predictive Modeling (ML).
- **Business Focused:** Insights and models tailored to real business scenarios in hospitality.
- **End-to-End Data Pipeline:** From raw data → clean data → dashboards → predictions.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project showcases how hospitality businesses can use data science and business intelligence tools together to make smarter, faster, and more profitable decisions.
