## üìà Insights & Recommendations

### 1. **Overall Business Performance**
- The total revenue across all cities is **‚Çπ1.71 billion**, with an **Average Revenue Per Guest** of approximately **‚Çπ6,200**.
- The overall **occupancy rate** is **57.9%**, indicating potential to improve room utilization and drive incremental revenue.

> üîÆ **Future Potential**: Even a 10% uplift in occupancy could lead to a revenue increase of ‚Çπ2‚Äì3 Cr monthly, assuming current ADR holds.

---

### 2. **City-Level Revenue Contribution**
- **Mumbai** dominates with **39% of the total revenue**, driven by high occupancy and ADR.  
- In contrast, **Delhi contributes only 17%**, despite having similar capacity.
- **Hyderabad and Bangalore** show moderate performance but still trail Mumbai by a large margin.

> üìå **Recommendation**: Consider redistributing marketing budgets and running targeted campaigns in Delhi and Hyderabad to improve yield.

---

### 3. **Room Class Performance**
- **Elite rooms** have the highest booking frequency and contribute the most revenue, while **Presidential rooms**, though fewer in volume, generate maximum revenue per guest due to high ADR (>‚Çπ18K).
- **Standard rooms** have low occupancy and generate the least revenue.

> üí° Bundle or rebrand Standard rooms with limited-time offers to improve occupancy and reduce underutilization.

---

### 4. **Booking Platform Efficiency**
- Online platforms (MakeMyTrip, Tripset) drive significant volume but experience **higher cancellation rates (up to 11%)**.
- **Direct bookings via office** show higher realization % (over 78%), indicating stronger guest commitment and profitability.

> üè∑Ô∏è Incentivize direct bookings through loyalty programs or discount codes to improve realization and reduce platform commissions.

---

### 5. **Guest Behavior & Pricing Strategy**
- The **average spend per guest** is around **‚Çπ6,200**, a strong indicator of guest willingness to pay in the luxury segment.
- Given the disparity in revenue contribution (**Mumbai at 39% vs. Delhi at 17%**), a **dynamic pricing model** is recommended to maximize revenue per available room.

> üìà **Actionable Tip**: Use data-driven pricing strategies (based on demand, season, platform, and room class) to optimize profitability across cities.
