# Hospitality ML project

In the competitive hospitality industry, data-driven decision-making is critical. This project leverages historical hotel booking data to:

- Predict hotel revenue and occupancy rates.

- Identify the most likely hotel property for new bookings.

- Segment customers based on booking behavior and geography.


Machine learning workflows were built on top of an in-depth exploratory data analysis [EDA](https://github.com/karan-bodara/advance_hospitality_analysis/tree/main/eda) , ensuring data-driven feature selection and model relevance.
